# REACT_Portfolio

## Description 
This repo contains Jaquelin Galindo's portfolio. Using REACT, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to create a website that demonstrate's Jackie's work as a software engineer. In total there are 6 technical projects that highlight my skills. 

## Home

This is my splash page and it holds my linkedin, resume, github, and a mini bio. 

## About Me
On this page I use Bootstrap cards to highlight different aspect of my life such as my education, hobbies, volunteer activities.

## Projects 
This page I use to highligh my technical skills. I breakdown the work I have done and link it to each repo. For the projects that do not have a repo do to contracted work I provide a detailed description of the role I had on the team and the value I provided. Again, I use bootstrap cards to highlight the different projects.

## Contact
On this page I provide the user a form to enter a message. Currently the submit button does not work, but will soon. Again I am leveraging Bootstrap to use a jumbtron. I also add an email icon for style.
